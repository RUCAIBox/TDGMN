## Motivations

Person-job fit has been an important task which aims to automatically match job positions with suitable candidates. Previous methods mainly focus on solving the match task in single-domain setting, which may
not work well when labeled data is limited. We study the domain adaptation problem for person-job fit. We first propose a deep global match network for capturing the global semantic interactions between two
sentences from a job posting and a candidate resume respectively. Furthermore, we extend the match network and implement domain adaptation in three levels, i.e., sentence-level representation, sentence-level match, and global match. Extensive experiment results on a large real-world dataset consisting of six
domains have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model, especially when there is not sufficient labeled data.	.
